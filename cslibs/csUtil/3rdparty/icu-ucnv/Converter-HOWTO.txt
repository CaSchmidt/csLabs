0.) Naming convention:

ICU stores its data/resources in a separate file, eg.

source/data/in/icudt61l.dat

The "61" indicates ICU's version, "l" indicates the endianness.

1.) Obtaining the conversion data:

Use ICU's icupkg tool to list (-l) or extract (-x) the desired information.

2.) Assembling a new data file:

pkgdata -m static -p icudt61l -e icudt61 -L icudata-x64 -s files converters.txt

Where

-p icudt61l  is the search path ICU will use when resolving data
-e icudt61   is the linker's entry point for the data

3.) Creating C code to include in a program:

Just run ICU's genccode on the created data file.
